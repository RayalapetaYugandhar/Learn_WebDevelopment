<!-- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses tags to structure content on web pages.
        Tags are used to define elements and their attributes, which tell web browsers how to display the content.
        HTML tags are typically enclosed in angle brackets "<>".

                            EXAMPLES

                    Here are some common HTML tags:

    <html> defines the beginning and end of an HTML document.

    <head> Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to external resources. -->
